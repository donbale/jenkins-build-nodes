The Aria Networks Jenkins setup uses AWS spot instances nodes to run jobs and build installers.

These nodes are based on Golden AMI images which are fired up upon start and torn down after 20 minutes of no activity.

This repository contains the code needed to build these images either as AWSs AMIs to replace the current Jenkins nodes or VirtualBox OVAs for local development.
